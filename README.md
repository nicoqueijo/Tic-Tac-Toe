# Tic-Tac-Toe game in Java. Played between two players on the console.

Assignment 3 Specifications

Due: 29 September 2016 - class time.

Output: Write algorithms and programs to play Tic-Tac-Toe - refer to P7.6 on page 372 in the text. Note: Tic-Tac-Toe should start with the X player first, followed by the O player. Output will include prompting the user for coordinates (row, column) of the next move, displaying the game map (not with a GUI) with each move, changing players after each successful move, and pronouncing the game winner - if any. Displaying map must label rows and columns appropriately.


Input: Input will entail prompting and validating for a valid move. Your prompts must clearly indicate how to make a legal move. Illegal moves will be re-prompted and validated. Valid input will be a combination of row and column that is valid for the game map. Additionally, a move can only be made to an empty map location.


Requirements: Use only material covered in the first eight chapters. Style requirements as discussed in class expected. 

You must write at least two programs: one would be the Tic-Tac-Toe class that provides the appropriate methods and variables for determining when a game is won and for displaying the game map; and one tester class that will perform the actions required to conduct and terminate a game (with a winner, if any). 


Submission: Include program documentation that provides clear instructions for how to compile and execute your program on the FIU SCIS. Your program must be able to compile and execute on FIU SCIS, using the “java” compiler. 
Efficiency should always be considered. Choose the most appropriate loop/decision structures and variable types. 

Algorithm (pseudocode) must be submitted in a separate text file and included with the Moodle posting and class submission. 
If your source code does not compile, I will no longer edit to correct. If for any reason I cannot get your source code to compile & execute, your grade will drop by an additional 25 points.
Print out a copy of all source code and both text files and submit in class - stapled. Post a .zip file — with all source code files and text files — on the Moodle web site.
Program should include a signed disclaimer (comment) in the heading, as follows:
	"I hereby certify that this collective work is my own and none of it is the work of any other person or entity."  
Include your name and student id. Class submission must include your signature and be stapled.
